# Check_GT_PDE
Simple code to check consistency of PDE with GT data used for training Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

PDEs usually require rescaling before use as a custom loss function to train PINNs. GT data also may not always be compatible with the PDEs used. This can be used to check compatibility.
